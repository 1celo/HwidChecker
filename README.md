## DISCLAIMER
I want to emphasize that I do not condone cheating under any circumstances. My intention is solely educational, aimed at promoting legitimate learning and understanding. It's important to clarify that while discussing HWID spoofers, I do not endorse or encourage their usage. However, it's worth noting that certain features may complement HWID spoofers effectively.

## Download
1. Download in releases or "<> Code" > "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the ZIP folder
3. Open checker.bat to view details of your HWID

## Commands
### !recheck
This command enables you to verify your HWID and other details after resetting your HWID or considering other factors
### !exit

You can also use the X but !exit works while you are in the code
